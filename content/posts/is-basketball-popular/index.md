## Basketball vs Football in India

Basketball is only marginally more popular than football in India. Both sports are national pastimes and are broadcast daily on television channels. Many fans follow their favourite teams through the season via live games or on television broadcasts.

> Although basketball has several loyal fans, it lacks the same level of mass support as football does. In addition, many fans prefer football's more physical nature over basketball's slower tempo-oriented style. Nevertheless, basketball is growing in popularity among Indian fans of both sports.
