## Learning Under Coach Ishwar Bhati

As a basketball player for nearly **7 years**, some of the best learning experiences I have had have come from **Coach Ishwar Bhati** in India.

His training at the **IB Sports Academy** has truly helped me develop a strong foundation as a player. His attention to detail helped me to truly find mistakes in how I played and how to correct them.

> Ishwar sir focuses on the fundamentals, and even as many NBA greats say, the fundamentals are the most important part of the game.

## Mastering the Fundamentals

He helped me to shoot the basketball much better as well as **work on my weaknesses such as left-hand layups and dribbling**. He made sure that I gave my best every day. Most importantly, his continued encouragement and enthusiasm never failed to keep me motivated.

## Balancing Studies and Sports

As a **student-athlete**, I have understood the importance of involving sports in my life alongside my studies. Not only does it give me a **break from studying and a chance to refocus myself, but having some form of exercise leaves me feeling energetic throughout the day.**

Dedicating time to basketball as well as studies helped me **improve my time management skills drastically**. I have to be responsible enough to make sure I use my time wisely. This made me much more conscious of how I spend my time as well as how to study more efficiently.

## Life Lessons from the Court

> **Basketball is a game with a lot of communication**, and this in turn has translated into my day-to-day life in being able to communicate effectively with my peers and teachers as well as being able to do tasks as a team/group.

The most important thing I learnt playing basketball is **hard work and perseverance**. There is no replacement for hard work, and playing sports has helped me to bring that relentlessness into my studies and day-to-day life.
