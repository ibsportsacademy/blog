> *"Every child is a star. Some shine on the court. Some on the screen. And some, on both."*
> — Aamir Khan x IB Sports Academy


## ✨ Magic of Collaboration: IB x Aamir Khan

In a country where cricket often overshadows other sports, something extraordinary happened behind the scenes of a Bollywood production. **Aamir Khan Productions**, while developing their emotionally charged new film **Sitaare Zameen Par**, reached out to IB Sports Academy, not just to borrow a backdrop, but to embed truth, grit, and raw inspiration into the heart of their film.

Over weeks of collaboration, IB provided more than just basketball courts. We provided **youth athletes, creative feedback, location access, technical guidance**, and most importantly — **authenticity**. This wasn’t just a shoot. It was a shared mission.

It all culminated in a celebratory photoshoot and heartfelt interaction session, bringing together our young athletes, **Head Coach Ishwar Bhati**, and the legend himself, **Aamir Khan**, where stars from two very different worlds met, face to face.


## 🏀 From Coaching Drills to Camera Rolls

Imagine the scene: bright-eyed athletes aged 12 to 17, jerseys crisp, sneakers laced, hearts pounding. Not for a final buzzer shot, but to share space with a man who’s been inspiring India for decades.

Aamir didn’t come to watch a match. He came to thank. To listen. To inspire. The players from Delhi stood proudly alongside him, not as extras, but as **collaborators** in a story bigger than themselves.

He signed basketballs. Jerseys. Even blank pages, each a canvas for dreams yet to be written. But most importantly, he signed off on a message: **“You matter. Your story matters. And India needs to see you shine.”**

## 🎬 About **Sitaare Zameen Par**: A Film with Heart

Directed by the visionary Aamir Khan, **Sitaare Zameen Par** is a spiritual successor to **Taare Zameen Par** but this time, the spotlight is on the **hidden champions of the field, the court, and beyond**.

This movie is a celebration of children who defy odds — who express themselves not through conventional excellence but through passion, perseverance, and raw talent. Themes of **neurodiversity**, **resilience**, **dream-chasing**, and **mentorship** echo through every frame.

That’s why IB Sports made sense.

> We don't just build athletes. We build stories. We shape futures. And we believe, just like this film, that a child’s spark only needs the right sky to shine.


## 🌠 What This Meant to Our Athletes

For our students, this wasn’t just a photo op. This was representation. This was proof that what they do matters — not just in the eyes of a coach, but in the lens of a camera that will show their world to millions.

They’ll never forget the handshake. The laughter. The moment they became part of a bigger story.
