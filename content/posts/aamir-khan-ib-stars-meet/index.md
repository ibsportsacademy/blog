## ✨ Magic of Collaboration: IB x Aamir Khan

In a country where cricket often overshadows other sports, something extraordinary happened behind the scenes of a Bollywood production. **Aamir Khan Productions**, while developing their emotionally charged new film **Sitaare Zameen Par**, reached out to IB Sports Academy, not just to use a sports setting, but to bring a touch of grassroots authenticity into their story.

Over days of collaboration, IB Sports Academy became a vibrant part of the shoot. We brought in **our Head Coach - Ishwar Bhati, youth athletes, and the spirit of real grassroots sport** to help bring **authenticity** to the shoot. This wasn’t just a shoot. It was a collaboration rooted in a shared passion for sports and youth empowerment.

It all culminated in a celebratory photoshoot and heartfelt interaction session, bringing together our young athletes, **Head Coach Ishwar Bhati**, and the legend himself, **Aamir Khan**, where stars from two very different worlds met, face to face.


## 🏀 From Coaching Drills to Camera Rolls

Imagine the scene: bright-eyed athletes, jerseys crisp, sneakers laced, hearts pounding. Not for a final buzzer shot, but to share space with a man who’s been inspiring India for decades.

Aamir didn’t come to watch a match. He came to meet. To interact. And to share moments that our athletes will never forget. The players from Delhi stood proudly alongside him, **contributing** real energy to scenes that aimed to reflect the **spirit of youth sports**.

He signed basketballs. Jerseys. Even blank pages, each a canvas for dreams yet to be written. But most importantly, he signed off on a message: **“You matter. Your story matters. And India needs to see you shine.”**

## 🎬 About **Sitaare Zameen Par**: A Film with Heart

Produced by the visionary Aamir Khan and directed by R. S. Prasanna, **Sitaare Zameen Par** is a spiritual successor to **Taare Zameen Par** but this time, the spotlight is on the **hidden champions of the field, the court, and beyond**.

This movie is a celebration of children who defy odds, who express themselves not through conventional excellence but through passion, perseverance, and raw talent. Themes of **neurodiversity**, **resilience**, **dream-chasing**, and **mentorship** echo through every frame.

That’s why IB Sports Academy, Delhi's leading youth basketball training organization made sense.

> We don't just build athletes. We build stories. We shape futures. And we believe, just like this film, that a child’s spark only needs the right sky to shine.


## 🎥 Coach on Camera: Ishwar Bhati’s Cameo in *Sitaare Zameen Par*

While much of our collaboration happened behind the scenes, there’s a moment early in *Sitaare Zameen Par* where fiction and reality truly blur.

In the **opening basketball match sequence between Delhi and Karnataka**, audiences catch a special glimpse of **IB Sports Academy’s very own Head Coach, Ishwar Bhati**, stepping into a small but meaningful on-screen role. Portraying the **Karnataka team’s coach**, Coach Bhati appears opposite Aamir Khan, who plays the assistant coach of the Delhi squad.

You’ll see him in **multiple background shots**, strategizing from the sidelines, observing the match with the intensity only a real coach could bring. Even his **distinctive car** makes an appearance, a subtle nod to the real people and real stories behind this cinematic journey.

Though it’s a brief role, it reflects the spirit of real-life coaches who dedicate their lives to shaping young athletes across India.


## 🌠 What This Meant to Our Athletes

For our students, this wasn’t just a photo op. This was representation. This was proof that what they do matters, not just in the eyes of a coach, but in the lens of a camera that will show their world to millions.

They’ll never forget the handshake. The laughter. The moment they became part of a bigger story.
