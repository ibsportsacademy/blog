Some shine on the court. Some on the screen. And some, on both.\u0026rdquo; — Aamir Khan x IB Sports Academy\n✨ Magic of Collaboration: IB x Aamir Khan # In a country where cricket often overshadows other sports, something extraordinary happened behind the scenes of a Bollywood production. Aamir Khan Productions, while developing their emotionally charged new film Sitaare Zameen Par, reached out to IB Sports Academy, not just to borrow a backdrop, but to embed truth, grit, and raw inspiration into the heart of their film.\nOver weeks of collaboration, IB provided more than just basketball courts. We provided youth athletes, creative feedback, location access, technical guidance, and most importantly — authenticity. This wasn’t just a shoot. It was a shared mission.\nReel Meets Real — Aamir Khan steps into character as the Basketball coach Gulshan, guided by the real one: Ishwar Bhati, the Head Coach of IB Sports Academy. It all culminated in a celebratory photoshoot and heartfelt interaction session, bringing together our young athletes, Head Coach Ishwar Bhati, and the legend himself, Aamir Khan, where stars from two very different worlds met, face to face.\n🏀 From Coaching Drills to Camera Rolls # Imagine the scene: bright-eyed athletes, jerseys crisp, sneakers laced, hearts pounding. Not for a final buzzer shot, but to share space with a man who’s been inspiring India for decades.\nAamir didn’t come to watch a match. He came to thank. To listen. To inspire. The players from Delhi stood proudly alongside him, not as extras, but as collaborators in a story bigger than themselves.\nWhen stars align: Aamir Khan with IB Sports Academy athletes and crew. He signed basketballs. Jerseys. Even blank pages, each a canvas for dreams yet to be written. But most importantly, he signed off on a message: “You matter. Your story matters. And India needs to see you shine.”\nEvery autograph carries a story — this one, written in sweat, discipline, and dreams. More than just ink — a message of belief, straight from Aamir Khan to the IB family. 🎬 About Sitaare Zameen Par: A Film with Heart # Directed by the visionary Aamir Khan, Sitaare Zameen Par is a spiritual successor to Taare Zameen Par but this time, the spotlight is on the hidden champions of the field, the court, and beyond.\nThis movie is a celebration of children who defy odds — who express themselves not through conventional excellence but through passion, perseverance, and raw talent. Themes of neurodiversity, resilience, dream-chasing, and mentorship echo through every frame.\nSabka Apna Apna Normal - Sitaare Zameen Par by Aamir Khan Productions That’s why IB Sports made sense.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t just build athletes. We build stories. We shape futures. And we believe, just like this film, that a child’s spark only needs the right sky to shine.\n🌠 What This Meant to Our Athletes # For our students, this wasn’t just a photo op. This was representation. This was proof that what they do matters — not just in the eyes of a coach, but in the lens of a camera that will show their world to millions.\n“I\u0026rsquo;ve seen Aamir Khan on screen all my life. Today, he saw me. That changes everything.” — An IB Academy player\nThey’ll never forget the handshake. The laughter. The moment they became part of a bigger story.\nSigned with heart: A keepsake that reminds us that stars don’t just belong in movies. 🤝 IB Sports x Cinema: Elevating Real Stories # This collaboration isn’t a first, it’s part of a growing legacy. Over the years, IB Sports Academy has partnered with several Bollywood productions, offering real locations, real athletes, and real energy that brings on-screen stories to life.\nWhat makes this journey with Sitaare Zameen Par special is how it deepens that legacy — placing our student-athletes at the heart of a film that celebrates youth, resilience, potential and basketball.\nNot just a player — a symbol of possibility. At IB Sports Academy, we continue to open our doors to:\n🎥 Filmmakers seeking authentic youth-centered narratives 🏀 Brands looking to connect meaningfully with the next generation 🌍 Social impact creators pursuing truth, inspiration, and reach Team Sitaare Zameen Par x IB Sports Academy Want to co-create something powerful?

Basketball is a team sport and is played at both professional and collegiate levels. Basketball is a game of strategy as players have to work together on the court to score baskets. The rules of basketball are universal and can be adapted to various formats to suit the needs of the players and the spectators.\nThe popularity of basketball in India is on the rise thanks to the Indian Super League and the NBA. Basketball has become a stable career for many people in India. Many people from rural areas now seek a livelihood playing professional basketball in India. This has effectively transformed a once-neglected sport into one that has widespread support. As more people seek to make a living from basketball, the sport will only gain momentum in India.\nBasketball vs Football in India # Basketball is only marginally more popular than football in India. Both sports are national pastimes and are broadcast daily on television channels. Many fans follow their favourite teams through the season via live games or on television broadcasts.\nAlthough basketball has several loyal fans, it lacks the same level of mass support as football does. In addition, many fans prefer football\u0026rsquo;s more physical nature over basketball\u0026rsquo;s slower tempo-oriented style. Nevertheless, basketball is growing in popularity among Indian fans of both sports.\nRole of the Indian Super League # The Indian Super League has brought basketball to many Indian fans. The Indian Super League started in February 2014 with eight teams participating. Eight teams competed through a double round-robin format before culminating in a championship game between Mumbai Indians and Chennaiyin Giants. The league expanded to 12 teams by 2017 with Bangalore as its headquarters. Fans from all over India travel to watch games at stadiums in their respective cities.\nBasketball matches now have higher attendance than other sports in major Indian cities.\nLooking Ahead # Basketball is gaining popularity among Indian fans thanks to professional leagues, television broadcasts, and high attendance numbers at stadiums. The success of the Indian Super League has made basketball more accessible for new fans and given it a boost among existing ones.\nOver time, this increase in popularity will see an increase in player wages and lead to better facilities for athletes training for the games competitive nature will only increase this support further!\n🏀 Ready to Elevate Your Game? # Join the movement!

While many students around us have a great potential that is yet to be seen or tapped into, we believe that all students just practice away from becoming great players. Community outreach means lending a helping hand to those who need it. Participation and interactivity increase awareness and provides a personal familiarity. It can also help to improve the health of the community and serve as a way of giving back to the community. Realizing that we have great potential around us would only bring us closer to a better and healthier youth. Sports has always been one of the best ways to unite a community.\nStudent-athletes at Don Bosco Ashalayam training in Basketball with IB Sports Academy. Role of Sports in Shaping Youth # Through sports, we not only teach the youth how to be healthy both physically and mentally but also teach them valuable lessons like Team building, a spirit of sportsmanship, unity, hard work, work ethics, teamwork, overcoming adversity, and most of all Respect. What sports can teach someone and how it can impact the life of the student remains unmatched. Most children at young age forget how to respect those around them, team sports teach them how to not only respect their coach but also themselves, their peers, their family and teach them how to be calm during severe adversities. While India progresses in terms of sports and physical education, it is important to move forward with equity and equality.\nMany people often relate basketball with just a game that improves or might improve the height of their child but, we\u0026rsquo;re here to tell you that it is much more than that. It is a game that improves the overall health of the student, keeps them active, makes them better at building team spirit, improves their communication skills, boosts their confidence, and much more.\nHead Coach Ishwar Bhati with basketball students of Don Bosco Ashalayam. The enthusiastic students eager to learn and high potential in each of them. Why Community Outreach Matters # Our main motive of starting a community outreach program was to give back to the society that has given us so much starting with the youth. This program gives us the ability to influence the next generation to be better and to do better. Especially when it comes to children, we believe that the things that you teach them at a young age, they can carry it well into their future as they are impressionable. You will also be planting the idea of the importance of focusing on community service and outreach programs. And as a result, it will influence their future, and they can also influence their parents and other siblings.\nGiving Back Through Coaching # In the light of giving back to the society and expecting nothing in return, IB Sports Academy has begun a community service of teaching Basketball to the young boys at Don Bosco Ashalayam, Palam, New Delhi.\nOne of the key components for coaches is to teach the student-athletes about service. The aim is to mentor and build character in the lives of youth through the sport of basketball. This community service is to outreach, educate and discipline as well to encourage an active \u0026amp; healthy lifestyle among the boys.\nAs the first step towards community outreach, we have collaborated with Don Bosco Ashalayam, New Delhi. The kind of enthusiasm they showed while training was beyond anything that we have ever seen. Dedicating our time and efforts to a community that truly deserves it made it possible for us to conduct our program with them. With this, we hope to have many such programs and we hope to conduct many more workshops for a better and brighter future.\n🏀 Ready to Elevate Your Game? # Join the movement!

His attention to detail helped me to truly find mistakes in how I played and how to correct them.\nIshwar sir focuses on the fundamentals, and even as many NBA greats say, the fundamentals are the most important part of the game.\nMastering the Fundamentals # He helped me to shoot the basketball much better as well as work on my weaknesses such as left-hand layups and dribbling. He made sure that I gave my best every day. Most importantly, his continued encouragement and enthusiasm never failed to keep me motivated.\nBalancing Studies and Sports # As a student-athlete, I have understood the importance of involving sports in my life alongside my studies. Not only does it give me a break from studying and a chance to refocus myself, but having some form of exercise leaves me feeling energetic throughout the day.\nDedicating time to basketball as well as studies helped me improve my time management skills drastically. I have to be responsible enough to make sure I use my time wisely. This made me much more conscious of how I spend my time as well as how to study more efficiently.\nLife Lessons from the Court # Basketball is a game with a lot of communication, and this in turn has translated into my day-to-day life in being able to communicate effectively with my peers and teachers as well as being able to do tasks as a team/group.\nThe most important thing I learnt playing basketball is hard work and perseverance.
