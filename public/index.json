Some shine on the court. Some on the screen. And some, on both.\u0026rdquo; — A reflection inspired by the shared spirit of Aamir Khan’s Sitaare Zameen Par and IB Sports Academy’s mission\n✨ Magic of Collaboration: IB x Aamir Khan # In a country where cricket often overshadows other sports, something extraordinary happened behind the scenes of a Bollywood production. Aamir Khan Productions, while developing their emotionally charged new film Sitaare Zameen Par, reached out to IB Sports Academy, not just to use a sports setting, but to bring a touch of grassroots authenticity into their story.\nOver days of collaboration, IB Sports Academy became a vibrant part of the shoot. We brought in our Head Coach - Ishwar Bhati, youth athletes, and the spirit of real grassroots sport to help bring authenticity to the shoot. This wasn’t just a shoot. It was a collaboration rooted in a shared passion for sports and youth empowerment.\nReel Meets Real | In Sitaare Zameen Par, Aamir Khan transforms into coach Gulshan against the vibrant backdrop of real basketball culture. Among the opening scenes, eagle-eyed viewers will spot Ishwar Bhati, Head Coach of IB Sports Academy, stepping into the frame as the Karnataka team’s coach, a subtle but powerful nod to the real mentors behind the game. It all culminated in a celebratory photoshoot and heartfelt interaction session, bringing together our young athletes, Head Coach Ishwar Bhati, and the legend himself, Aamir Khan, where stars from two very different worlds met, face to face.\n🏀 From Coaching Drills to Camera Rolls # Imagine the scene: bright-eyed athletes, jerseys crisp, sneakers laced, hearts pounding. Not for a final buzzer shot, but to share space with a man who’s been inspiring India for decades.\nAamir didn’t come to watch a match. He came to meet. To interact. And to share moments that our athletes will never forget. The players from Delhi stood proudly alongside him, contributing real energy to scenes that aimed to reflect the spirit of youth sports.\nWhen stars align: Aamir Khan with IB Sports Academy athletes and crew. He signed basketballs. Jerseys. Even blank pages, each a canvas for dreams yet to be written. But most importantly, he signed off on a message: “You matter. Your story matters. And India needs to see you shine.”\nEvery autograph carries a story — this one, written in sweat, discipline, and dreams. More than just ink — a message of belief, straight from Aamir Khan to the IB family. 🎬 About Sitaare Zameen Par: A Film with Heart # Produced by the visionary Aamir Khan and directed by R. S. Prasanna, Sitaare Zameen Par is a spiritual successor to Taare Zameen Par but this time, the spotlight is on the hidden champions of the field, the court, and beyond.\nThis movie is a celebration of children who defy odds, who express themselves not through conventional excellence but through passion, perseverance, and raw talent. Themes of neurodiversity, resilience, dream-chasing, and mentorship echo through every frame.\nSabka Apna Apna Normal | Sitaare Zameen Par by Aamir Khan Productions That’s why IB Sports Academy, Delhi\u0026rsquo;s leading youth basketball training organization made sense.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t just build athletes. We build stories. We shape futures. And we believe, just like this film, that a child’s spark only needs the right sky to shine.\n🎥 Coach on Camera: Ishwar Bhati’s Cameo in Sitaare Zameen Par # While much of our collaboration happened behind the scenes, there’s a moment early in Sitaare Zameen Par where fiction and reality truly blur.\nIn the opening basketball match sequence between Delhi and Karnataka, audiences catch a special glimpse of IB Sports Academy’s very own Head Coach, Ishwar Bhati, stepping into a small but meaningful on-screen role. Portraying the Karnataka team’s coach, Coach Bhati appears opposite Aamir Khan, who plays the assistant coach of the Delhi squad.\nSpot the Coach! Ishwar Bhati, leading the Karnataka Basketball Team in the opening game sequence of Sitaare Zameen Par. You’ll see him in multiple background shots, strategizing from the sidelines, observing the match with the intensity only a real coach could bring. Even his distinctive car makes an appearance, a subtle nod to the real people and real stories behind this cinematic journey.\nAamir Khan as Delhi\u0026rsquo;s Assistant Coach and Ishwar Bhati, leading the Karnataka Basketball Team in the opening game sequence of Sitaare Zameen Par. Though it’s a brief role, it reflects the spirit of real-life coaches who dedicate their lives to shaping young athletes across India.\n🌠 What This Meant to Our Athletes # For our students, this wasn’t just a photo op. This was representation. This was proof that what they do matters, not just in the eyes of a coach, but in the lens of a camera that will show their world to millions.\n“I\u0026rsquo;ve seen Aamir Khan on screen all my life. Today, he saw me. That changes everything.” — An IB Academy player\nThey’ll never forget the handshake. The laughter. The moment they became part of a bigger story.\nSigned with heart: A keepsake that reminds us that stars don’t just belong in movies. 🤝 IB Sports x Cinema: Elevating Real Stories # This collaboration isn’t a first, it’s part of a growing legacy. Over the years, IB Sports Academy has partnered with several Bollywood productions, offering real locations, real athletes, and real energy that brings on-screen stories to life.\nWhat makes this journey with Sitaare Zameen Par special is how it deepens that legacy, placing our student-athletes at the heart of a film that celebrates youth, resilience, potential and basketball.\nNot just a player | A symbol of possibility. This collaboration offered a glimpse into how sports and cinema can connect, not as equals, but as complementary forces. While IB Sports Academy played a small but proud role in bringing real youth energy to a cinematic story, the spotlight rightly belongs to the film and its powerful message. We’re grateful to have been even a small part of its journey.\nTeam Sitaare Zameen Par x IB Sports Academy At IB Sports Academy, we continue to open our doors to:\n🎥 Filmmakers seeking authentic youth-centered narratives 🏀 Brands looking to connect meaningfully with the next generation 🌍 Social impact creators pursuing truth, inspiration, and reach R.

Basketball is a team sport and is played at both professional and collegiate levels. Basketball is a game of strategy as players have to work together on the court to score baskets. The rules of basketball are universal and can be adapted to various formats to suit the needs of the players and the spectators.\nThe popularity of basketball in India is on the rise thanks to the Indian Super League and the NBA. Basketball has become a stable career for many people in India. Many people from rural areas now seek a livelihood playing professional basketball in India. This has effectively transformed a once-neglected sport into one that has widespread support. As more people seek to make a living from basketball, the sport will only gain momentum in India.\nBasketball vs Football in India # Basketball is only marginally more popular than football in India. Both sports are national pastimes and are broadcast daily on television channels. Many fans follow their favourite teams through the season via live games or on television broadcasts.\nAlthough basketball has several loyal fans, it lacks the same level of mass support as football does. In addition, many fans prefer football\u0026rsquo;s more physical nature over basketball\u0026rsquo;s slower tempo-oriented style. Nevertheless, basketball is growing in popularity among Indian fans of both sports.\nRole of the Indian Super League # The Indian Super League has brought basketball to many Indian fans. The Indian Super League started in February 2014 with eight teams participating. Eight teams competed through a double round-robin format before culminating in a championship game between Mumbai Indians and Chennaiyin Giants. The league expanded to 12 teams by 2017 with Bangalore as its headquarters. Fans from all over India travel to watch games at stadiums in their respective cities.\nBasketball matches now have higher attendance than other sports in major Indian cities.\nLooking Ahead # Basketball is gaining popularity among Indian fans thanks to professional leagues, television broadcasts, and high attendance numbers at stadiums. The success of the Indian Super League has made basketball more accessible for new fans and given it a boost among existing ones.\nOver time, this increase in popularity will see an increase in player wages and lead to better facilities for athletes training for the games competitive nature will only increase this support further!\n🏀 Ready to Elevate Your Game? # Join the movement!

While many students around us have a great potential that is yet to be seen or tapped into, we believe that all students just practice away from becoming great players. Community outreach means lending a helping hand to those who need it. Participation and interactivity increase awareness and provides a personal familiarity. It can also help to improve the health of the community and serve as a way of giving back to the community. Realizing that we have great potential around us would only bring us closer to a better and healthier youth. Sports has always been one of the best ways to unite a community.\nStudent-athletes at Don Bosco Ashalayam training in Basketball with IB Sports Academy. Role of Sports in Shaping Youth # Through sports, we not only teach the youth how to be healthy both physically and mentally but also teach them valuable lessons like Team building, a spirit of sportsmanship, unity, hard work, work ethics, teamwork, overcoming adversity, and most of all Respect. What sports can teach someone and how it can impact the life of the student remains unmatched. Most children at young age forget how to respect those around them, team sports teach them how to not only respect their coach but also themselves, their peers, their family and teach them how to be calm during severe adversities. While India progresses in terms of sports and physical education, it is important to move forward with equity and equality.\nMany people often relate basketball with just a game that improves or might improve the height of their child but, we\u0026rsquo;re here to tell you that it is much more than that. It is a game that improves the overall health of the student, keeps them active, makes them better at building team spirit, improves their communication skills, boosts their confidence, and much more.\nHead Coach Ishwar Bhati with basketball students of Don Bosco Ashalayam. The enthusiastic students eager to learn and high potential in each of them. Why Community Outreach Matters # Our main motive of starting a community outreach program was to give back to the society that has given us so much starting with the youth. This program gives us the ability to influence the next generation to be better and to do better. Especially when it comes to children, we believe that the things that you teach them at a young age, they can carry it well into their future as they are impressionable. You will also be planting the idea of the importance of focusing on community service and outreach programs. And as a result, it will influence their future, and they can also influence their parents and other siblings.\nGiving Back Through Coaching # In the light of giving back to the society and expecting nothing in return, IB Sports Academy has begun a community service of teaching Basketball to the young boys at Don Bosco Ashalayam, Palam, New Delhi.\nOne of the key components for coaches is to teach the student-athletes about service. The aim is to mentor and build character in the lives of youth through the sport of basketball. This community service is to outreach, educate and discipline as well to encourage an active \u0026amp; healthy lifestyle among the boys.\nAs the first step towards community outreach, we have collaborated with Don Bosco Ashalayam, New Delhi. The kind of enthusiasm they showed while training was beyond anything that we have ever seen. Dedicating our time and efforts to a community that truly deserves it made it possible for us to conduct our program with them. With this, we hope to have many such programs and we hope to conduct many more workshops for a better and brighter future.\n🏀 Ready to Elevate Your Game? # Join the movement!

His attention to detail helped me to truly find mistakes in how I played and how to correct them.\nIshwar sir focuses on the fundamentals, and even as many NBA greats say, the fundamentals are the most important part of the game.\nMastering the Fundamentals # He helped me to shoot the basketball much better as well as work on my weaknesses such as left-hand layups and dribbling. He made sure that I gave my best every day. Most importantly, his continued encouragement and enthusiasm never failed to keep me motivated.\nBalancing Studies and Sports # As a student-athlete, I have understood the importance of involving sports in my life alongside my studies. Not only does it give me a break from studying and a chance to refocus myself, but having some form of exercise leaves me feeling energetic throughout the day.\nDedicating time to basketball as well as studies helped me improve my time management skills drastically. I have to be responsible enough to make sure I use my time wisely. This made me much more conscious of how I spend my time as well as how to study more efficiently.\nLife Lessons from the Court # Basketball is a game with a lot of communication, and this in turn has translated into my day-to-day life in being able to communicate effectively with my peers and teachers as well as being able to do tasks as a team/group.\nThe most important thing I learnt playing basketball is hard work and perseverance.

Then comes a film like Chhalaang, a movie that hits home in more ways than one. It’s not just about a teacher. It’s about transformation. It’s about belief. It’s about the underdogs, our students, finding their voice, their strength, and their moment.\nChhalaang Movie: A must watch for Students, Teachers, Parents \u0026 Coaches. 🏀 From Benchwarmers to Believers # In Chhalaang, Rajkummar Rao plays a lazy, reluctant PT teacher who’s more into chilling than coaching, until he\u0026rsquo;s pushed to prove his worth. What starts as a personal challenge turns into a powerful mission: to inspire a group of overlooked, underestimated kids to believe in themselves and compete head-to-head with the “elite” players.\nThis reminded me so much of real coaching life.\nHow often do we see kids written off at 10/100? Called \u0026ldquo;slow,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;not talented,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;just average\u0026rdquo;? But sports is the great equalizer. It doesn’t care where you come from, it cares how much heart you bring. And with the right guidance, even those who are counted out can rise, improve, compete, and win - in games and in life.\n\u0026ldquo;Teacher ka kaam hai sikhana. 90 laane waale ko 100 tak toh koi bhi le ja sakta hai. 10 waale ko 40 tak le jaao toh baat hai\u0026rdquo; – Teacher Neelu\nChhalaang Movie: Rajkumar Rao a.k.a. Coach Montu teaching Basketball and sports to Underdogs 🔴🔵 Red Pill, Blue Pill - Two Coaches, Two Realities # Which Coach Would You Choose Team Red after Losing vs Team Blue after Winning The two teams face off in three intense showdowns: Basketball, Relay Race, and Kabaddi, testing not just their skills, but their teamwork, mindset, and will to win.\nOne of my favorite scenes in Chhalaang doesn’t even involve a match, it’s what happens after the match.\nThe red team, the underdogs, just lost. But their coach doesn’t scold them. Instead, he lifts them up, reminding them they played like champions.\n\u0026ldquo;80 points se jeetne waali team sirf 8 points se jeeti hai bas. You made that possible!”\nIt’s not a consolation. It’s a reframing of belief, he tells them: you belong here.\nMeanwhile, the blue team, the winners, are pumped, until their coach hits them with cold logic.\n“80 points se haarne waali team sirf 8 points se haari hai bas. Nothing to celebrate.”\nThat’s not just a reality check, it’s a celebration hijacked by perfectionism. You can see it on their faces: their joy replaced with confusion, maybe even doubt.\nAnd this is where it hit me like a scene from The Matrix: You’ve got two pills, two coaching philosophies.\n🔴 Red pill: Encourage effort, build belief, nurture growth. 🔵 Blue pill: Demand perfection, push discipline, focus on results.\nWhich one builds champions? Which one builds people?\n🧠🧘‍♂️ Sports Is Education Too # After the underdogs pull off the unthinkable and win, Coach Montu doesn’t just celebrate the victory, he delivers a mic-drop moment that stays with you long after the final whistle. Standing before the crowd, he reminds everyone that behind every great athlete is someone who believed in them before the medals came: a parent, a teacher, a coach.\n\u0026ldquo;Humaare desh mein na har koi chahta hai ki unka beta Sachin Tendulkar bane, beti Saina Nehwal bane. Par Sachin aur Saina ka maa-baap koi na banna chahta. Sachin Tendulkar, Saina Nehwal, Virat Kohli, Sania Mirza, P.V. Sindhu, Dipa Karmakar, Vishwanathan Anand, Abhinav Bindra, Dhanraj Pillay, Pullela Gopichand, Dhyan Chand, Sakshi Malik, Geeta Phogat, P.T. Usha, Mary Kom, Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Mithali Raj, Bhaichung Bhutia, Sunil Chhetri, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and many many more. Yeh banne ke liye inke maa-baap, inke coach, inke PT master banne ki zaroorat parti hai. Akele na ban pata koi. Humaare bacche bhi ban jaayenge, par uske pehle hume banna padega\u0026rdquo; – Coach Montu\nThat line hit deep. Every coach, every teacher has heard some version of this. Parents dream of greatness for their kids, but often forget the value of supporting them through the ups and downs. The movie shows how the other teacher and coach\u0026rsquo;s father visits each parent, one by one, convincing them not just to let their kids play, but to truly believe in them.\nWe need more of that. Because Sports is not a Distraction. It’s a Discipline! It teaches resilience, time management, leadership, respect, health, humility, and confidence. A basketball court or a football field is just as much a classroom as any other.\n👨‍🏫 What a Coach Can Do # Chhalaang isn’t just about the students. It’s about the journey of the coach too. His evolution from disinterested instructor to driven mentor was truly inspiring. As a PT teacher, I saw my own story in parts of his: that moment when you stop teaching and start leading. When your mission becomes bigger than the syllabus, you’re building people.\nAnd that’s exactly what we aim to do every day at IB Sports Academy, not just train athletes, but shape confident, disciplined, and inspired individuals ready to take on the world.\nAnd yes, the ending was a bit “movie-style”, the underdogs somehow clinch victory. But honestly? That’s the dream every coach holds. Not just to win trophies, but to watch your kids grow from unsure to unstoppable.\nChhalaang Movie: A must watch for Students, Teachers, Parents \u0026 Coaches. 💡 Lessons On and Off the Field # Here are some of the most powerful messages from Chhalaang that every parent, coach, and young athlete should take to heart:\nBelief is the first step. Kids become what you believe about them. Playing is not wasting time. It’s building life skills, body strength, and mental toughness. Support matters. Every Sehwag, every Sindhu, every Chhetri had someone who stood behind them. School sports are serious. It’s not just “extra” activity. It’s essential. Coaches shape futures. With the right mix of discipline and inspiration, a coach can change lives. Balance is key. Sports and studies must go hand in hand, for full development, not just marksheets. 💬 Coach’s Corner # After watching Chhalaang, I was left with fire in my heart and a notebook full of quotes. Here are a few that still stick with me:\n\u0026ldquo;Khelne se padhai bigadti nahi hai\u0026hellip; par sirf padhai se zindagi banegi, yeh zaruri nahi.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Haar-jeet toh lagi rehti hai. Ladayi se pehle faisla kabhi mat sunana, na mukil ko, na khud ko\u0026hellip; chahe kitna bhi saaf kyun na dikhayi de raha ho ki haar hogi, faisla to jirah ke baad hi hoga. Beta, jeet aksar unki ho jaya karti hai jo haar manna taal-te chale jaate hain. Bas ek gawaah aur, ek sawaal aur. Bas ek jirah aur. Chhorna mat.\u0026rdquo; – Montu’s Father (Wakeel Sahab)\n🎓 Did You Know? Rajkummar Rao Was a Teacher Before Becoming a Bollywood Star? In fact, he was the youngest teacher in school! Before lighting up the silver screen with his incredible performances, Rajkummar Rao actually worked as a dance and drama teacher! 🎭🕺\n📣 A Call to All Parents and Teachers # If you’re a parent reading this: let your kids play. Not just on Sundays or after exams. Let them train. Let them fall, sweat, lose, and rise. Support them not because you see a medal, but because you see a child growing stronger every day.\nIf you’re a teacher or coach: keep going. Your words matter. Your energy lifts. Your faith changes futures.\nAnd if you’re a student-athlete: keep hustling. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re the first pick or the last one on the bench, your story is being written with every drop of sweat. One day, your Chhalaang will come.\n🎬 Final Thoughts # Chhalaang isn’t just a film — it’s a reminder. That every child deserves a chance. That every game is a lesson. And that when coaches, parents, and kids come together, magic happens.\nJust like on our courts here at IB Sports Academy, where every day, we don’t just coach games. We coach greatness.\nTeam IB Sports Academy with Head Coach Ishwar Bhati 🏀 Ready to Elevate Your Game? # Join the movement!
